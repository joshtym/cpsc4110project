**CPSC 4110 Programming Project**
---------------------------------
This project will act as a python implementation to the greedy approach to solving the Unweighted Vertex Cover Problem. This problem can be defined below.

**Input** : A set of verticies and edges, denoted V and E respectively. For the sake of this project, the input should have sets of connected vertices on new lines such as follows with each vertex denoted by a number:  
1 3  
4 5  
3 4  
2 1  

etc.
For the sake of simplicity, please number the verticies 1 - n where you have n verticies and don't pick random symbols to represent the vertices.

**Output** : A minimal vertex covering such that every edge is connected to one of the 'picked' vertices.
